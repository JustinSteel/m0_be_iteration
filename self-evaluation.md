# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
It can pull each element down and run it through whatever you set it up to do to filter stuff or 
just assign things that meet a criteria to a word or something.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
How to optimize my steps rather than sometimes using too many steps to accomplish a task that takes less.
I will practice and have other people look at it to see how they would do it.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
I would say playing around with it in irb helped alot to see if i was forgeting steps.
